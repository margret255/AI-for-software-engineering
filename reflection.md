## Ethical AI Considerations

-  Ensured datasets were balanced (no class was overly dominant).
- No personal or sensitive data was used.
- Bias was considered: we discussed fairness in entity detection and accuracy in digit classification.
- Optimization focused on accuracy while avoiding overfitting through early stopping and dropout layers.
